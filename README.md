This is a medical image classification project. 

The dataset contains ~85K retinal images with four classes - three disorders (CNV, DME, Drusen) and a Normal class (baseline). 

We used Xception as our model, and trained from scratch without weights for 1,000 epochs. 

We visualize our inference results by using the GradCAM methodology. 

Both the model and the GradCAM functions were developed by Francois Chollet from Google.
